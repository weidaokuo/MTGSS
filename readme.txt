**From Scalars to Curves: Generative Full-Response Modeling for Refractory Alloy Design**

## Overview

Materials research is increasingly driven by trajectory- or spectrum-like data—such as stress-strain curves, creep histories, and spectroscopic profiles—that encode rich physical information beyond scalar properties. However, conventional machine learning approaches typically reduce such data to point-wise predictions, overlooking their sequential and path-dependent nature.

This repository supports the code in the study.
