**Data-driven design of Nb-W refractory alloys using Transformer-based stress-strain modeling**

## Overview

Generative AI provides a powerful route for predicting material behavior in data-scarce regimes, an especially pressing challenge for refractory alloys where extreme processing environments and high melting points hinder large-scale data collection. Here, we introduce a Transformer-based generative framework that models the entire deformation trajectory rather than focusing solely on isolated scalar properties (such as YS, UTS), by synthesizing full stress–strain curves of Nb–W-based refractory alloys. Applied to Nb521-derived systems, the model captures the sequential evolution of tensile deformation and accurately predicts elastic–plastic responses across a wide compositional and processing space.

This repository supports the code in the study.
